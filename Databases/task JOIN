1) -- List users full names who gave a 5-star review by using subqueries.
	        // subqueries
SELECT full_name
       FROM exploreplaces.users
       WHERE user_id IN (
             SELECT user_id

      r.comment
          FROM exploreplaces.reviews r
          JOIN exploreplaces.users u ON r.user_id = u.user_id
          WHERE r.rating = 5; --Correct just rating is missing in select

3) -- List all users with their review, even if they haven’t written any reviews.

                      // add  u.user_id let's see user_id`5
SELECT  
       u.full_name,
        r.comment, u.user_id
           FROM exploreplaces.reviews r
        RIGHT JOIN  exploreplaces.users u 
       ON r.user_id = u.user_id ; --Correct
 
 4) Get all restaurants with their cuisine type and city names.
 
 SELECT 
    r.name AS restaurant_name,
    c.cuisine_name AS cuisine,
    ci.city_name AS city
FROM exploreplaces.restaurants r
JOIN exploreplaces.cuisine c ON r.cuisine_id = c.cuisine_id

ORDER BY ci.city_name, r.name; -- Correct

5) -- Show the list of restaurants names that have received reviews, along with the comments,
 names of users who wrote those reviews and rating score.
 
 SELECT r.name,
       u.full_name,
       reviews.comment,
       reviews.rating
FROM exploreplaces.reviews
	join exploreplaces.restaurants as r
       on reviews.restaurant_id =r.restaurant_id

       6)  List hotels and restaurants located in the same city. Show hotel,
       restaurant  names : also would  be nice to return city name as well.

SELECT 
    h.name AS hotel_name,
    r.name AS restaurant_name,
    h.location AS city_name
FROM exploreplaces.hotels AS h
JOIN exploreplaces.cities AS c
    ON h.location = c.city_name
JOIN exploreplaces.restaurants AS r
    ON r.city_id = c.city_id;
       
       7)-- Find users who reacted to reviews but haven’t written any reviews themselves-> use joins and where
      
      //  –––
SELECT  u.full_name, rr.reaction_type
FROM users u
JOIN review_reactions rr ON u.user_id = rr.user_id
LEFT JOIN reviews rev ON u.user_id = rev.user_id
WHERE rev.review_id IS NULL;

      
      8) -- List names of users who left reviews for both resturants and hotels.

     JOIN exploreplaces.hotels as h 
       ON rev.hotel_id=h.id
    WHERE rev.hotel_comment is not null 
	  AND rev.comment is not null;
      – In your created tables it can be correct but as a good practice you can have just 1 comment filed for a review table where a single review record cannot have both restaurant_id and hotel_id simultaneously.  
      
      
      9)-- Find users who joined before a "Carlos Martinez" user.
      Return both user names and their join dates.
